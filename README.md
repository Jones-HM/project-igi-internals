# Project I.G.I Internal

[Project I.G.I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_I.G.I.) Internal is Project to access internal methods of the game by using **DLL injection method** into the game and calling [IGI Natives methods](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI-Internals-Data/blob/main/IGI-Natives.json) to modify/alter the behaviour of the game.</br>
This was originally intended for research project to understand the game mechanics and how developers worked hard to create them.</br>
So don't use this project to misuse the game's identity and source of original game devs.</br>

## Pre-Requisite
- **General section.**
- [DLL File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) - This project is DLL file rather than standard application.</br>
- [DLL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection) - This project needs DLL injection into _IGI_ game.</br>
- [Hooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking) - This project uses [Minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) for API calls.</br>
- [GTLibc](https://github.com/Jones-HM/GTLibCpp) -C/C++ library for interactig with Game.</br>
- [Pattern Scanning](https://github.com/GH-Rake/PatternScan) - This project use pattern memory scanning to check Game/Player is loaded properly.</br>
- **Game specific section.**
- [IGI Graphs Structure](https://github.com/Jones-HM/project-igi-research-data/blob/main/Research/GRAPH/Graph-Structure.md) - Project IGI 1 Graph structure data.
- [IGI 3D Models](https://github.com/Jones-HM/project-igi-research-data/blob/main/Research/Natives/IGI-Models.json) - Project IGI uses 3D models in 
form of _MEF_ (**M**esh **E**xternal **F**ile).
- [IGI Camera View](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Definition-of-pitch-roll-and-yaw-angle-for-camera-state-estimation_fig15_273225757) - IGI use game Camera called [Viewport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewport) to display the game updates.
- **Native section.**
- Native Invoker - Native invoker is a technology to invoke native methods from Game using their **Hash** with its **Handler**. 

## Building DLL project.
Open this project in your favourite IDE _(Visual Studio)_ and build it and your output will be **Release/Debug** folder depends which configuration you choosed and you will find file _IGI-Internals-Release.dll_ so download your favourite DLL injector make sure its **x86(32-bit)** compatible otherwise injection wouldn't work or you can use recommended [IGI-Injector](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI-Injector) to inject DLL.

## Building project for IGI Editor.
The project could be build for [IGI Editor](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI1Editor) the only thing we need to change is **Features.cpp** file we have to update with **Features file for Editor** which could be found here [Features_Editor.cpp](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI_Internal/blob/master/IGI_Internal/Features_Editor.cpp)


## Modifying this project.
You can modify the project the only file you need to focus on is **Features file** which could be found here [Features.cpp](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI_Internal/blob/master/IGI_Internal/Features.cpp) in _DllMainLoop()_ method go to _MENU_SCREEN_INGAME_ section add you logic for Adding/Removing Buildings/Weapons/A.I etc into the game.</br>

There are shown 5 examples into _Features.cpp_ file.
- Enable Debug mode.
- Restart game.
- Weapon pickup.
- Frames setting
- Humanplayer load.

## Adding new hashes for Natives.
Lets say you found new hash for Native now how to add them into project and use them.
So you have to follow the steps.
1. First Add your Hash to _Natives.hpp_ class like this 
```cpp
  MY_FIRST_NATIVE = 0x00402F90
```
2. Go to Natives folder and open _NativeHelper.hpp_ file and in any relevant section add its definition.
```cpp
  NATIVE_DECL void MY_FIRST_NATIVE_LOAD() { NATIVE_INVOKE<Void>((Void)HASH::MY_FIRST_NATIVE); }
```
3. Now go to _Features.cpp_ class and use it. 
```cpp
  // Native method.
  if (GT_HotKeysPressed(VK_CONTROL, VK_F1)) {
	MY_FIRST_NATIVE_LOAD();
  }
```
